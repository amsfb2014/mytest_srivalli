            <strong>GENERAL INFORMATION.</strong>The MSA is licensed, not sold, to You by Asurion for use strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The MSA may be accessed and used only on certain, eligible mobile devices, and a complete list of those eligible mobile devices may be accessed at any time by visiting the Supported Phones section of <a class="link" href='#'><u>LABS QA</u></a>.  The MSA may provide You with access to a variety of functions, such as the Locate, Alarm, Lock, Erase, Sync, Anti-virus, App Assist and Safe Browsing functions (“MSA functions”).  Not all of the MSA functions may be available to You at all times.  As an example, due to technical limitations or issues, the Locate or Alarm functions may not be available to You when You are trying to locate Your mobile device.  Additionally, not all of the MSA functions may be available on all mobile devices.  As an example, the Safe Browsing, Lock and App Assist functions currently are not available on BlackBerry® mobile devices.  Asurion reserves the right, at any time, to modify, change, suspend or discontinue any or all of the MSA functions.  Asurion also reserves the right to suspend or discontinue Your access to the MSA if You fail to pay any fees or charges related to the MSA or otherwise violate the terms of this Agreement.  If Asurion modifies, changes, suspends or discontinues any of the MSA functions or Your access to the MSA, You may be prevented from accessing the data or information that You stored, synched or transmitted via the MSA.  The MSA website is located at <a class="link" href='#'><u>LABS QA</u></a> and may be accessed by You in order to access and use the MSA functions.  You may terminate this Agreement and Your use and access of the MSA at any time by uninstalling the MSA from Your mobile device and ceasing all use of the MSA.  If You have purchased access to the MSA, You additionally will need to contact Asurion at 866.653.4202 in order to stop incurring any additional monthly charges for the MSA.

            <strong>7. MSA COMMUNICATIONS.</strong>  The MSA and the MSA functions communicate with Your mobile device through messages that are sent in either SMS or other electronic form (“MSA Communications”).  As part of Your MSA purchase and activation process, You agreed to receive the MSA Communications on Your mobile device in either SMS or other electronic form.  You can, at any time, revoke that agreement and thereby stop receiving MSA Communications on Your mobile device, should You decide that You no longer want to receive any MSA Communications.  In order to stop receiving MSA Communications on Your mobile device, You must text “STOP” to 36587 and then uninstall the MSA.

You will not be able to access or use any of the MSA functions, and You will not have access to any of contacts that you may have backed up when using the Sync function of the MSA.  In order to avoid incurring any additional charges for the MSA after You have chosen to stop receiving MSA communications, You must contact Asurion at 866-653-4202.  Please see additional information regarding the MSA Communications in the SMS Message Disclosure below.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>8. REGISTRATION AND PASSWORDS.</strong>  In order to use the MSA and the MSA website, You must provide Us with Your e-mail address, create a password that is unique to You and answer certain security questions.  You acknowledge and agree that You will provide Us with true, accurate, current and complete information and that You will maintain and update that information as necessary, so that it continues to be true, accurate, current and complete.  If You provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete or We have reasonable grounds to suspect that You have provided such information, We have the right to suspend or terminate Your access to the MSA and the MSA website.  You are solely responsible for keeping Your password and Your answers to the security questions strictly confidential.  Anyone who has access to Your e-mail address and Your password or the answers to Your security questions can access and use the MSA on Your mobile device.  As an example, anyone with access to that information can use the MSA functions to Locate, Lock, Erase or Alarm Your mobile device without Your knowledge or consent.  If you suspect or know that the confidentiality of Your password or Your answers to the security questions has been compromised, You can change Your password or Your answers to the security questions at any time by visiting the MSA website at <a class="link" href='#'><u>LABS QA.</u></a>  You acknowledge and agree that You are responsible and solely liable for any claims, damages, losses, costs or other liabilities resulting from or caused by any failure by You to keep Your password and Your answers to the security questions confidential, whether such failure occurs with or without Your knowledge or consent.   
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9.  LOCATE FUNCTION.</strong>  If available to You, the Locate function of the MSA may allow You to determine the location of Your lost or misplaced mobile device.  The Locate function of the MSA provides You with only an estimated or approximate location of Your mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that (i) the results You obtain from the Locate function may not be accurate, timely, satisfactory or reliable; (ii) any information provided by the Locate function is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed; and (iii) the results of the Locate function are subject to uncontrollable factors associated with wireless networks and satellite data, such as environmental and atmospheric conditions, buildings and geography.  You should not use the Locate function to determine the location of Your mobile device if You believe or suspect that it has been stolen.  In that circumstance, You should seek assistance from Your local law enforcement agency.  You should not use any information provided by the MSA to physically recover a stolen mobile device or a mobile device that is located in an unsafe or unfamiliar place.  In no event shall Asurion have any liability to You or any third party for any injuries suffered or damages incurred as a result of Your attempt to locate or to physically recover Your mobile device.  You acknowledge and agree that the Locate function of the MSA is intended for Your personal use only and is not intended for use as an emergency locator system or to track the location of any individual.  The Locate function of the MSA uses global positing services (“GPS”) to secure real-time information about the location of Your mobile device (“Location Information”), and the Location Information is provided to Asurion.  By downloading the MSA, You acknowledge and agree that Asurion can collect, store, maintain, process, use, transmit and disclose the Location Information associated with Your mobile device and that You have no expectation of privacy regarding the Location Information associated with Your mobile device.  You may withdraw Your consent to the foregoing at any time by uninstalling the MSA from Your mobile device and terminating Your access and use of the MSA by calling Asurion at any time at 866-653-4202.  If You uninstall the MSA and terminate Your access and use of the MSA, the Location Information associated with Your mobile device will remain on the MSA website until Asurion deletes that information from the MSA website.  You acknowledge and agree that Asurion shall not be responsible for any failure in the functionality of the MSA or the Locate function that is caused by or related to the uninstalling the MSA, whether uninstalled by You or a third party, with or without Your knowledge or consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>10. SYNC FUNCTION.</strong>  If available to You, the Sync function of the MSA may allow You to create a backup copy of the contacts stored in Your mobile device (“Your Data”) on the MSA website.  If the Sync function is successful, You will be able to access Your Data on either Your mobile device or the MSA website.  You hereby grant Asurion the right to copy, transmit, store and use an archival backup copy of Your Data on data storage systems operated by or for Asurion (“Asurion Storage Systems”).  You acknowledge and agree that You will use the Sync function solely for the purpose of uploading Your Data to Asurion Storage Systems and You will not attempt to (i) back up, use or copy any other data or content that You do not have a legal right to back up, use or copy; or (ii) back up, use or copy any other data or content in a manner that infringes any copyrights or other intellectual property rights of any third party or misappropriates any proprietary or confidential information of any third party.  You acknowledge and agree that Asurion, in its sole discretion, may disable Your access to Your Data or delete Your Data from Asurion Storage Systems if it has received written notification of claimed infringement or misappropriation or otherwise has a reasonable belief that any part of Your Data (i) constitutes an infringement, misappropriation or violation of any third party intellectual property right; (ii) could damage, harm or tarnish Asurion’s reputation; or (iii) could cause Asurion to be liable to any third party, including any governmental entity. You acknowledge and agree that Asurion may access, preserve and disclose Your Data to anyone, if it is required to do so by law or as necessary to: (i) comply with the orders or instruction of any government, governmental authority, court or tribunal; (ii) enforce the terms of this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that Your Data violates the rights of any third party; (iv) respond to Your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Asurion, its licensees, end users or members of the public. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Asurion hereby disclaims any duty or obligation, stated or implied, to monitor or review any aspect of Your Data. Asurion has no responsibility or liability for any loss or destruction of Your Data or any failure to store or to provide access to Your Data through the MSA or the MSA website and may change the size and form of data that You can archive, the number of days that Your Data may be stored and the number times Your Data may be accessed.  You may set Your mobile device to automatically backup Your Data on a predetermined basis or You may manually backup Your Data at any time.  If Your Data is deleted by Asurion, none of Your Data can be recovered from the Asurion Storage Systems by Asurion, although You may still access Your Data on Your mobile device.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11.	ANTI-VIRUS, APP ASSIST AND SAFE BROWSING FUNCTIONS.</strong>  If available to You, the App Assist and Anti-Virus functions of the MSA may allow You to assess applications that are downloaded to Your mobile device and to protect Your mobile device from malware.  You should not rely solely on the information provided by the App Assist or Anti-Virus functions when deciding whether to keep or uninstall an application on Your mobile device.  The decision to keep or uninstall an application should be made by You, only after You consider all of the information available to You about the application and Your personal judgment and preferences.  If You decide to uninstall an application, You should be aware that You may not be able to uninstall some applications from Your mobile device or to stop those applications from running on Your mobile device.  Your ability to uninstall or to stop the running of an application depends upon the application’s conformance to its declared permissions, and Asurion does not have any control over or responsibility for those declared permissions.  The App Assist function of the MSA may not be able to provide You with an assessment of all applications available to You for download, since some of those applications may not be known or available to Asurion.  If the App Assist function of the MSA detects an application on Your mobile device that is not known or available to Asurion, You acknowledge and agree that Asurion may access and upload the application for further review and assessment.  In order for the Anti-Virus function of the MSA to work properly, it must be turned “on” by You, and it must remain “on” at all times.  Although the Anti-Virus function is designed and intended to detect malware on Your mobile device, it is impossible to detect and stop the effects of all malware.  You acknowledge and agree that Asurion shall not be responsible for any failure of the Anti-Virus function to detect or stop the effects of any malware on Your mobile device.  If available to You, the Safe Browsing function of the MSA may allow You to avoid inadvertently accessing known malicious websites by comparing the website You are seeking to access to a database of known malicious websites.  You should not rely solely on the Safe Browsing function when deciding whether to access or avoid a particular website.  The decision to access a website should be made by You, only after You consider all of the information available to You about the website and Your personal judgment and preferences.  A website may appear to be safe, but the information available from that website may not meet industry standards for security and privacy.    
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11. PAYMENT.</strong> You agree to pay all fees charged by Asurion for the MSA regardless of whether You have electronically downloaded, installed or used the MSA.  If You fail to pay the charges for the MSA when due, We will be entitled to pursue any and all legal remedies to collect the amounts owed by You and also will be entitled to, and are hereby authorized to, suspend the provision of the MSA and disable Your use of the MSA and the MSA functions until such fees are paid.  Asurion shall not be liable for any liabilities, losses or damages resulting from any failure in the functionality of the MSA caused by or resulting from Your failure to pay any amounts when due. Asurion hereby reserves the right to change the applicable fees for the MSA or the related service package at any time and will take reasonable efforts to provide You with prior notice of any such change.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>13.  SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF THE MOBILE APPLICATION SERVICES.</strong> When using the MSA, You shall: (i) observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive safely; (ii) use Your own personal judgment while driving a vehicle, operating any machinery, or otherwise engaging any activity that poses a risk to the health or safety of You or any other persons; (iii) not interact with the MSA unless You are in a safe, secure and stationary environment (e.g., a parked vehicle); (iv) not use the MSA for any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes or in any manner inconsistent with this Agreement; and (v) arrange all wireless devices and cables necessary for use of the MSA in a secure manner in Your vehicle so that they will not interfere with Your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device (e.g., an airbag).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>14.  COLLECTION, STORAGE AND USE OF INFORMATION AND PRIVACY POLICY.</strong>  You hereby authorize and consent to the collection, storage, sharing, use and transfer by Asurion and its Providers of any data and information that You provide to Asurion and its Providers or that is related to or derived from Your use of the MSA (“MSA Information”).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the MSA Information shall include, without limitation, the following types of data and information (in both written and audio form) in an aggregate (non-identifiable) form: location and other data.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, You shall not provide or disclose and the MSA Information shall not include any information or data that is personally identifiably to You (except for the personally identifiable registration information described in section 8 above, which shall be subject to the terms of the Asurion Privacy Policy).  The MSA Information will be treated as being non-confidential and nonproprietary, and Asurion assumes no obligation to protect confidential or proprietary information (other than personally identifiable information) from disclosure and will be free to reproduce, use, and distribute the MSA Information to others without restriction. We will also be free to use the MSA Information and any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in the MSA Information for any purpose whatsoever including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services incorporating such Information.  You acknowledge and agree that You will comply with the terms and conditions of the Asurion Privacy Policy, which sets forth and describes the practices of Asurion with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of information related to or derived from your use of the MSA.  
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>15.  COMPATIBILITY.</strong>  We do not warrant that the MSA will be compatible or interoperable with Your mobile device or any piece of hardware, software, equipment or device installed on Your mobile device or used by You to access and use the MSA in connection with Your mobile device (“Accessories”).  You acknowledge and agree that compatibility and interoperability problems can cause the performance of the MSA, Your mobile device and any Accessories to diminish or fail completely and may result in permanent the damage to Your mobile device and any Accessories, loss of data located on Your mobile device or Accessories, and corruption of software and files located on Your mobile device and any Accessories.  You acknowledge and agree that Asurion and its Providers shall have no liability to You for any losses suffered resulting from or arising in connection with compatibility or interoperability problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>16.  SECURITY OF THE MSA.</strong> The MSA is intended for Your personal use only. You acknowledge and agree that the MSA may be disabled or uninstalled from Your mobile device at any time, even when the MSA functions are activated. You further acknowledge and agree that the MSA may not function properly, may contain errors or bugs and is susceptible to breach, corruption or failure. If the MSA malfunctions or fails or is disabled or uninstalled from Your mobile device, with or without Your knowledge or consent, the MSA will not operate. You are solely responsible for any claims, liability, losses or damages arising out of the unauthorized disclosure, transfer or use of any personal content, data or materials stored on Your mobile device for any reason, even if occurring as a result of a failure in the MSA or from disabling or uninstalling the MSA, with or without Your knowledge or consent.

            <strong>24.  ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong> You hereby acknowledge and agree that You have carefully reviewed the following Arbitration Agreement, understand the impact of this Arbitration Agreement on Your rights (including the waiver of Your right to require trial by jury or to participate in a class action proceeding), and agree to be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
        <ol class="termsOl" type="a">
            <li>
                Most of Your concerns about this Agreement or the MSA can be addressed simply by contacting Asurion at 1-866-862-3397.  In the unlikely event We cannot resolve any disputes, including any claims under this Agreement, that You or We may have, <strong>YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF THROUGH COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION.  YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.  YOU AND WE AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, MATTER OR PROCEEDING REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF.</strong>  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury.  It has more limited discovery than in court and is subject to limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, but any damages awarded in connection with a claim arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations on types and amounts of damages set forth in Sections 21 & 22, above.
            </li>
            <li>
                This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly, and it includes any dispute:  (1) arising out of or relating in any way to the MSA or to this Agreement or to the relationship between You and Us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or otherwise; (2) that arose either before this Arbitration Agreement or this Agreement was entered into by You and Us or that arises after this Arbitration Agreement or this Agreement is terminated; and (3) that currently is the subject of a purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude You from bringing an individual action in small claims court or from informing any federal, state or local agencies or entities of Your dispute.  Such agencies or entities may be able to seek relief on Your behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
                If You or We intend to seek arbitration You and We must first send to the other a written Notice of Claim (“Notice”) by certified mail.  Your Notice to Us should be addressed to: Legal Department, P.O. Box 110656, Nashville, TN 37122-0656.  The Notice must describe the dispute and state the specific relief sought.  If You and We do not resolve the dispute within 30 days of receipt of the Notice, You or We may initiate an arbitration proceeding with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).  You can obtain the forms necessary to initiate an arbitration proceeding by visiting www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  After We receive notice that You have commenced arbitration, We will reimburse You for payment of any filing fee to the AAA.  If You are unable to pay a required filing fee, We will pay it if You send a written request by certified mail to: Legal Department, P.O. Box 110656, Nashville, TN 37122-0656.  The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”) in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.  You can obtain a copy of the Arbitration Rules by visiting www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
            </li>
            <li>
                The arbitrator appointed by the AAA to decide the dispute is bound by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement, with the exception that issues relating to the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement may be decided by a court.  Unless You and We agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county or parish where Your billing address is located, according to Our records, but not outside the United States of America.  If Your dispute is for $10,000 or less, You may choose to conduct the arbitration hearings either by submitting documents to the arbitrator or by appearing before the arbitrator in person or by telephone.  If Your dispute is for more than $10,000, the right to arbitration hearings will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  We will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement, unless Your dispute is found by the arbitrator to have been frivolous or brought for an improper purpose under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).  In that case, the payment of such fees shall be governed by the Arbitration Rules.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the conclusion of the arbitration hearings, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision which includes an explanation of the facts and law upon which the decision is based.  If the arbitrator finds in Your favor and issues a damages award that is greater than the value of the last settlement offer made by Us, or if We made no settlement offer and the arbitrator awards You any damages, We will: (1) pay You the amount of the damages award or $7,500, whichever is greater; and (2) pay Your attorney, if any, twice the amount of the attorney's fees and the actual amount of any expenses reasonably incurred when pursuing Your dispute in arbitration.  You and We agree not to disclose any settlement offers to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has issued the written decision.  The arbitrator may resolve any disputes regarding attorney's fees and expenses either during the arbitration hearings or, upon request, within 14 days of the arbitrator's written decision.  While the right to the attorney’s fees and expenses discussed above is in addition to any right You may have under applicable law, neither You nor Your attorney may recover duplicate awards of attorney’s fees and expenses.  Although We may have the right under applicable law to recover attorney’s fees and expenses from You if We prevail in the arbitration, We hereby waive the right to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the extent either declaratory or injunctive relief is sought in the arbitration, such relief can be awarded only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by a party's individual claim.  <strong>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong>  Unless You and We agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate the dispute of another person with Your or Our dispute and may not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>25.  NO RIGHT OF SURVIVORSHIP.</strong>  You agree that Your right to access and use the MSA is non-transferable and that any rights to Your Data terminate upon Your death.
