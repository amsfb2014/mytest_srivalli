        Asurion LABS is available through selected partners. The technology works by communicating with your personal wireless device via both Internet access and SMS messages. As part of the purchase and activation process you will be asked to &quot;opt in&quot; to receive all SMS messages. If you choose not to &quot;opt in&quot; you will not be able to use Asurion LABS. After opting in upon purchase, you will receive an opt-in confirmation SMS message on your mobile phone. Please follow the remaining opt-in instructions as provided in the SMS message. During the course of using this product, you may choose to &quot;opt out&quot; of receiving SMS messages. However, since Asurion LABS will not function without SMS delivery, &quot;opt out&quot; may result in your account being suspended and you may lose access to all features and any backed up data. If you wish to permanently terminate your account, <a class="linktext" href="faqs.html">click here</a> for more information.
