            <span>Device access scoring</span>	
            App Assist analyzes a variety of metrics to provide a Device Access Score for each app installed on your phone. These metrics include potential risks such as access to your personal information, your location, and high battery/resource utilization. App Assist displays a scoring bar that indicates whether an app has low device access (few bars) or high device access (many bars).
