            <b>Location accuracy</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Location accuracy is determined by a number of factors, including things like proximity to a cell tower, signal strength, and the phoneâ€™s current location (GPS reading are more accurate if your phone is outdoors). To ensure the most accurate locations possible, make sure all Location Services (GPS, etc.) settings on your phone are set to ON.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>To check Location Services settings:</b>
        </p>
